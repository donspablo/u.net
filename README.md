The funds will enable me to continue working full-time and developing fantastic applications, in addition to upgrading and maintaining my existing ones. I have created a fundraising page specifically for the purpose of storing my related fundraising materials. Your support would be really helpful and greatly appreciated - Thank you 🙏</i></p>
